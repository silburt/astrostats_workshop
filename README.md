This repo contains the tutorials for the June 4-8th, 2018 Astroinformatics summer school at Penn State, clustering and classification session. The data used is a collection of 25,000 3-planet N-body systems simulated with REBOUND for 1e9 orbital periods of the innermost planet. The data is part of a series of papers in prep by [Naireen Hussain](https://github.com/Naireen), [Dan Tamayo](https://github.com/dtamayo), [Christian Gilbertson](https://github.com/christiangil) and [Ari Silburt](https://github.com/silburt), and is a continuation of the work by [Tamayo, Silburt et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05359).
